# DESIGN AND SIMULATE 8:1 MULTIPLEXER USING VERILOG

## AIM

To design a 8:1 multiplexer and verify its truth table in Quartus using Verilog programming,validate its outputs.

## HARDWARE REQUIRED:
Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher

Software – Quartus prime

## THEORY

### What is a Multiplexer

The multiplexer is a device that has multiple inputs and single line output. The select lines determine which input is connected to the output, and also increase the amount of data that can be sent over a network within a certain time. It is also called a data selector.

Multiplexers are capable of handling both analog and digital applications. In analog applications, multiplexers are made up of relays and transistor switches, whereas in digital applications, the multiplexers are built from standard logic gates. When the multiplexer is used for digital applications, it is called a digital multiplexer.

The single-pole multi-position switch is a simple example of a non-electronic circuit of the multiplexer, and it is widely used in many electronic circuits. The multiplexer is used to perform high-speed switching and is constructed by electronic components.

A multiplexer is a digital circuit that selects one input from multiple inputs based on the select inputs. The 8:1 MUX has 8 data inputs, 3 select inputs, and 1 output. The select inputs determine which data input is routed to the output.
